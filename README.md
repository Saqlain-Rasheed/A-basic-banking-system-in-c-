this is a console based  basic banking system made in c programming language

Q: What this program do?
Ans: I made this simple basic banking system.In this program we can create a new account
    and can manage this acount by changing password and can do some transactions and deposites.
    
    The big good thing about this code is that it create a new .txt file for every new account creation.
    
    but this program use and read data from .Dat file which is written in binary using fwrite() function.
    
    
    thank you :)
